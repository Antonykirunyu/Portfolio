            <p>Hi! I'm Antony Kirunyu, <b>web-developer student</b>
                <br> at moringa school, based in Nairobi-Kenya.
                <br>I was born in Mukurwe-ini in Nyeri county. I am
                <br>19 years old. I started schooling in the year 2004
                in Ngamwa primary school, Mukurwe-ini. I come from a
                <br>humble background, my parents were peasant farmers
                <br> who struggled hard to make ends meet.

            <h3><strong>Interest</strong></h3>
        <div id="interest" class="active2">
            <p>I love solving problems.Whether it's finding the most
            <br>hard way to write a line of code which fitsbest in a 
            <br>proggression.I love thechallenge of discovering a 
            <br>solution in a code statement.I also love activities 
            <br>like dancing.What am interested in most islistening 
            <br>to music and acting.

        <h3><strong>Programming decision</strong></h3>
        <div class="active2">
            <p>I decided to persue programming because One of the very
            best reasons to become a computer programmer is the bounty
            of jobs out there. As other industries decline and 
            cease to be, programming is growing and expanding into almost
            all areas of life. Generally as a software developer you 
            will be working on a huge variety of projects, large and 
            small. Each new project that you work on brings a whole 
            new set of challenges and gives you the opportunity to learn
            about new technologies, different systems as well as new parts of the business
