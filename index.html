        <h2><strong><span>About</span></strong> me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Antony Kirunyu, <b>web-developer student</b>
            <br> at moringa school, based in Nairobi-Kenya.
        </p>
        <p>I love solving problems.Whether it's finding the most
        <br>hard way to write a line of code which fitsbest in a 
        <br>proggression.I love the challenge of discovering a 
        <br>solution in a code statement.I also love activities 
        <br>like dancing.What am interested in most is listening 
        <br>to music and acting.

        </p>
        <p>I decided to persue programming because One of the very
            <br>best reasons for a computer programmer is the bounty
            <br>of jobs out there. As other industries decline and 
            <br>cease to be, programming is growing and expanding into almost
            <br>all areas of life. Generally as a software developer you 
            <br>will be working on a huge variety of projects, large and 
            <br>small. Each new project that you work on brings a whole 
            <br> new set of challenges and gives you the opportunity to learn
            <br> about new technologies, different systems as well as new 
            <br>parts of the business
